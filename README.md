AMI-TWIG.js
===========

[AMI-TWIG.js](http://www.cern.ch/ami/twig/) is a JavaScript implementation for NodeJS and browsers of the [SensioLabs's TWIG template engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/).


Getting started
===============

### Loading AMI-Twig.js server-side:

```javascript
let amiTwig = require('ami-twig.min.js').amiTwig;
```

### Loading AMI-Twig.js client-side:

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript" src="ami-twig.min.js"></script>
```

### Using AMI-Twig.js:

```javascript
let textResult = amiTwig.engine.render(twigTemplate, optionalDict, optionalTwigTemplates);
```

where *optionalDict* contains all the global variables for the template.

For optimization perposes, templates can be compiled before rendering:

```javascript
let compiledTemplate = amiTwig.engine.compile(twigTemplate);

let textResult = amiTwig.engine.render(compiledTemplate, optionalDict, optionalTwigTemplates);
```
